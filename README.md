## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox



### What I learned
1. Common coding in stylesheet
2.Using list padding to customize the look of a style.
  ul,ol{
      padding: 1.25rem;
  }

### Continued development

Maybe it can be pixel perfect according to design. I designed it now with assumption and refrences from other projects.
